/** The base type for all plugins.

 * <ol>
 * <li>{@link #load(QuiltPluginContext, Map)} is called to set the {@link QuiltPluginContext}.</li></li>
 * <li>Quilt Loader will scan all files in those folders, and follow these steps:
 * <ol>
 * <li>If it ends with ".disabled", or is a system or hidden file, then it is skipped.</li>
 * <li>If it is a zip or jar file (or can be opened by {@link FileSystems#newFileSystem(Path, ClassLoader)}) then it
 * will be opened, and checked for a "quilt.mod.json" file. If one is found, then it is loaded as a quilt mod (and
 * possibly as a new plugin - which will be loaded instantly, rather than waiting until the next cycle).</li>
 * <li>If "quilt.mod.json" couldn't be found then the zip root will be passed to
 * {@link #scanZip(Path, ModLocation, PluginGuiTreeNode)}</li>
 * <li>Otherwise it will be passed to {@link #scanUnknownFile(Path, ModLocation, PluginGuiTreeNode)}</li>
 * </ol>
 * </li>
 * <li>{@link #beforeSolve()} is called.</li>
 * <li>Loader will begin solving the rules added</li>
 * </ol>
 * In particular, plugins must never call {@link QuiltLoader} directly - that's designed solely for mods to use after
 * mod loading is complete. */
