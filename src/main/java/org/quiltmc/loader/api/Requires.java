/** Applied to declare that the annotated element requires specific mods to exist.
 * <p>
 * When applied to mod code this will result in quilt-loader removing that element when running without all of the specified mods.
 * <p>
 * When the annotated element is removed, bytecode associated with the element will not be removed. For example, if a
 * field is removed, its initializer code will not, and will cause an error on execution.
 * <p>
 * If an overriding method has this annotation and its overridden method doesn't, unexpected behavior may happen. If an
 * overridden method has this annotation while the overriding method doesn't, it is safe, but the method can be used
 * from the overridden class only when specified mods are found.
 * <p>
 * When applied to an implemented interface (via {@link ElementType#TYPE_USE}) it will be removed when running without the specified mods.
 * Overridden interface methods need to be annotated separately in order to be removed.
 *
 * @apiNote Even is this annotation is provided by Quilt Loader, some usages of it are not recommended. In example, when
 * you are using code from other mods thanks to their APIs using entrypoints, you should not implement their entrypoint
 * interface on the same classes that you are using for vanilla entrypoints. Instead, you should use a separate class in
 * a separated package, dedicated to the mod integration that you are making. And to continue this example by a great usage
 * of this annotation, you could use it in a new package-info.java file of the current package dedicated for the
 * mod integration, in order to trim the complete package, which will provide an additional safety layer by avoiding
 * errors when loading and / or calling classes and elements that should not when the required mod is not present. */
