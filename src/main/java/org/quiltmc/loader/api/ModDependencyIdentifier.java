/**
 * A dependency identifier is a combination of a maven group and a mod id.
 *
 * <p>Generally just the mod id will suffice for most dependency declarations.
 *
 * <p>The maven group is particularly useful in cases where depending on a specific fork of a mod is desired, typically
 * where mod compatibility does not work without a fork. The fork of the mod would declare it's {@code quilt.mod.json}
 * exactly the same as the upstream mod, but declare a different maven group to allow distinguishing between the two
 * mods sharing the same id inside dependency declarations.
