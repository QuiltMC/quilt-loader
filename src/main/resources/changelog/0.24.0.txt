Features:

- Improved lists of versions in the error gui (Glitch):
    - For example `Iris requires a version in the range { [0.5.7, 0.5.7] U [0.5.8, 0.5.8] U [0.5.9, 0.5.9] } of sodium`
      is now described as `Iris requires version 0.5.7, 0.5.8, or 0.5.9 of sodium`
- Updated to Quilt Config 1.2 (ix0rai)
- Added a new unknown or unsupported file screen, which shows a warning if neoforge, forge, or modloader mods are found in the mods folder, or any other unknown files.
    - That screen is also shown in a table in the log.
- Moved more of loaders GUI abstractions to the api package.
    - Most mods will have no use for these, as they are primarily intended for early warnings.
- [#385](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quilt-loader/pull/385) Added "Path Retention" to the plugin management system. This is a major improvement, and brings loader plugins much closer to stabilising.
    - Plugins can now scan files & folders for mods if the plugin was loaded after the file or folder was originally found.
- Improved fabric to quilt metadata handling.
- Added "net.fabricmc.loader.impl.gui.FabricGuiEntry" and "net.fabricmc.loader.impl.gui.FabricStatusTree", as some mods use them. (Although these are *internal* classes in fabric-loader, so mods are discouraged from using them).

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed loader loading all images with BufferedImage and then storing them back as png files for the forked gui server, rather than just letting the gui server load them.
    - This fixes a crash on with some JVM distributions that are missing certain natives required for BufferedImage to work properly.
