Features:

- Added LanguageAdapter.getDefault(), to allow other LanguageAdapters to use it as their fallback.
- Added intermediary version detection on "Unfixable Conflicts" error, which just displays the mappings version verses the game version.
- Added legacy fabric loader class DependencyException, which broke a 1.17 version of Modern Industrialisation.
- [#369] Added some minecraft libraries to the transform cache - this allows mixin to run on them again.

Bug FIxes:

- Fixed net.fabricmc.loader.util.version.SemanticVersionImpl not being used for fabric versions, which broke a 1.17 version of SmootherBedrock.
- [#377] Added overlap detection to GamePatch.process, which fixes a 1.2.5 server not launching with quilt loader (#376).
- [#375] Fix "guarenteed" typo instead of "guaranteed" (ix0rai)
- [#371] Fix access widener remapping using the constant "named" instead of fetching the target namespace (heipiao233)

Changes from upstream (fabric-loader 0.14.23 and 0.14.24)

- Updated to ASM 9.6
- Added FabricLoader.invokeEntrypoints
- Fix a command injection vulnerability in vanilla Minecraft 20w21a -> 23w04a.

    Changelog from fabric:

    Fix a command injection vulnerability allowing malicious resource pack to unexpectedly execute code on Linux clients running vanilla Minecraft 1.16 (20w21a) -> 1.19.3 (23w04a).
    It was recently found that the Tiny File Dialogs library is vulnerable to command injection techniques on Linux when invoked with untrusted data. This fix makes a small change in the create world `MoreOptionsDialog` screen to pass a hardcoded string as the dialog title.
    Many thanks to ThatGravyBoat and Moulberry for investigating this issue and reporting it to fabric in confidence.
