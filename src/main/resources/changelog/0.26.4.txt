Bug fixes:

- Fixed an oversight where Loader can try to open a GUI in a headless environment
- Fixed the solver pre-processor sometimes removing a rule it's optimising when merging rules together.

Changes:

- Mixin compatibility level for quilt mods is currently set to 0.10.0. We'll add a way to change this in the future.
- Include the full solver pre-processor input and output state when it crashes.

Changes from updating Fabric Loader from 0.15.11 to 0.16.4:

- Updated mixin extras to 0.4.1
- Updated mixin to 0.15.3+mixin.0.8.7
- Added version parsing support for 1.21.2
- Include full entrypoint definition in entrypoint crashes.
- Added support for ignoring newer ASM versions on dedicated servers for 24w33a and later.
