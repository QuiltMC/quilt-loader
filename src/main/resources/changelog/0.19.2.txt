Features:

- Updated quilt.mod.json handling to be up-to-date with RFC 56:
    - Deprecated array values for "versions" in dependencies.
    - Added a more understandable "any" / "all" object system 
    - See https://github.com/QuiltMC/rfcs/pull/56 for more details.
- Added warnings when encountering dependency constraints that are unnecessary.
- Added "flags" to the mod table.
    - 'o' means that a mod has had one of its dependencies changed
    - 'R' means that a mod has had one of its dependencies removed.
    - These are only shown in the "plugin" mod table right now, they will be 
    added to the main mod table in the future.

Bug Fixes:

- [#321] "button.view_file" not translated in some places
- Fixed QuiltLoaderText not shouting loudly enough when something is wrong with the args.
- [#322] Fixed not being able to handle non-overlapping dependencies in fabric.mod.json files.
- Fixed French localisation not loading correctly all the time due to file encoding issues.
