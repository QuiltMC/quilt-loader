Deprecation:

* Deprecated the quilt-json5 exposed to mods. We shouldn't expose libraries directly in Loader unless we absolutely must (in case we want to break them!),
  and there's no reason to expose quilt-json5 here. It is being replaced by quilt-parsers, and mods are responsible for including it themselves if they want it.

Features:

* [#311] Updated Quilt Config to 1.1.0-beta.3
    * Added a new `ReflectiveConfig` interface, a replacement to `WrappedConfig` that is actually useful (you can modify the config now).
* Improved entrypoint exception handling a bit.
* Added error description for simple "breaks".
* [#336] Memory usage improvements during transform cache building (embeddedt)
* [#338] More optimisations to transform cache building. 
* Added the quilt loader version to the top of quilt-loader crash reports.
* Added an uncaught exception handler to every QuiltZipCustomCompressedWriter thread, and added it to the crash report.
* [#339] Added a new system property "loader.workaround.defer_all_filesystem_operations" which fixes "ClosedByInterruptException" on older versions of minecraft.
* [RFC#84] Removed the active user beacon.
* [#350] Cached mod path hashes once, rather than computing them when building a crash report.

Bug Fixes:

* Fixed the mods table being empty if quilt-loader crashed too early.
* Fixed `ConfigFieldAnnotationProcessors.register` not being public
* [#342] Fixed mods being able to replace classes in the `org.apache.logging.log4j.**` package.
