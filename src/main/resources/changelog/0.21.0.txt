Features:
- Move Loader's runtime transformers to the transform cache (#352)
  - This gives us a chance to dogfood the transform cache in more situations and may slightly reduce load times.
# TODO: add some information about the loom "mods" block and how to configure it
Bug Fixes:
- Transform cache no longer regenerates each launch (#356)
